<para id="fs-id2019483">The best-known feature of skeletal muscle is its ability to contract and cause movement. Skeletal muscles act not only to produce movement but also to stop movement, such as resisting gravity to maintain posture. Small, constant adjustments of the skeletal muscles are needed to hold a body upright or balanced in any position. Muscles also prevent excess movement of the bones and joints, maintaining skeletal stability and preventing skeletal structure damage or deformation. Joints can become misaligned or dislocated entirely by pulling on the associated bones; muscles work to keep joints stable. Skeletal muscles are located throughout the body at the openings of internal tracts to control the movement of various substances. These muscles allow functions, such as swallowing, urination, and defecation, to be under voluntary control. Skeletal muscles also protect internal organs (particularly abdominal and pelvic organs) by acting as an external barrier or shield to external trauma and by supporting the weight of the organs.</para>
<para id="fs-id1723952">Skeletal muscles contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis in the body by generating heat. Muscle contraction requires energy, and when ATP is broken down, heat is produced. This heat is very noticeable during exercise, when sustained muscle movement causes body temperature to rise, and in cases of extreme cold, when shivering produces random skeletal muscle contractions to generate heat.</para>
<para id="fs-id1989759">Each skeletal muscle is an organ that consists of various integrated tissues. These tissues include the skeletal muscle fibers, blood vessels, nerve fibers, and connective tissue. Each skeletal muscle has three layers of connective tissue (called “mysia”) that enclose it and provide structure to the muscle as a whole, and also compartmentalize the muscle fibers within the muscle (<link target-id="fig-ch10_02_01" document=""/>). Each muscle is wrapped in a sheath of dense, irregular connective tissue called the <term>epimysium</term>, which allows a muscle to contract and move powerfully while maintaining its structural integrity. The epimysium also separates muscle from other tissues and organs in the area, allowing the muscle to move independently.</para><figure id="fig-ch10_02_01"><title>The Three Connective Tissue Layers </title><media id="fs-id1203669" alt="This figure shows the structure of muscle fibers. The top panel shows a skeleton muscle fiber, and a magnified view of the muscle fascicles are shown.

<caption>Bundles of muscle fibers, called fascicles, are covered by the perimysium. Muscle fibers are covered by the endomysium.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id2278076">Inside each skeletal muscle, muscle fibers are organized into individual bundles, each called a <term>fascicle</term>, by a middle layer of connective tissue called the <term>perimysium</term>. This fascicular organization is common in muscles of the limbs; it allows the nervous system to trigger a specific movement of a muscle by activating a subset of muscle fibers within a bundle, or fascicle of the muscle. Inside each fascicle, each muscle fiber is encased in a thin connective tissue layer of collagen and reticular fibers called the <term>endomysium</term>. The endomysium contains the extracellular fluid and nutrients to support the muscle fiber. These nutrients are supplied via blood to the muscle tissue. </para><para id="eip-442">Each muscle fiber is composed of many myofibrils. Myofibrils contain many sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are the fundamental unit of skeletal muscle (see <link target-id="fig-ch10_02_02" document=""/>). Sarcomeres are composed of thick and thin myofilaments called myosin and actin, respectively. Actin and myosin are contractile proteins which are responsible for muscle contraction (see <link target-id="fig-ch10_02_02" document=""/>).</para><para id="fs-id1841712">Every skeletal muscle is also richly supplied by blood vessels for nourishment, oxygen delivery, and waste removal. In addition, every muscle fiber in a skeletal muscle is supplied by the axon branch of a somatic motor neuron, which signals the fiber to contract. Unlike cardiac and smooth muscle, the only way to functionally contract a skeletal muscle is through signaling from the nervous system.</para>

<title>Skeletal Muscle Fibers</title>
<para id="fs-id2122814">Because skeletal muscle cells are long and cylindrical, they are commonly referred to as muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle fibers can be quite large for human cells, with diameters up to 100 <emphasis effect="italics">μ</emphasis>m and lengths up to 30 cm (11.8 in) in the Sartorius of the upper leg. During early development, embryonic myoblasts, each with its own nucleus, fuse with up to hundreds of other myoblasts to form the multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers. Multiple nuclei mean multiple copies of genes, permitting the production of the large amounts of proteins and enzymes needed for muscle contraction.</para><para id="fs-id2125518">Some other terminology associated with muscle fibers is rooted in the Greek <emphasis effect="italics">sarco</emphasis>, which means “flesh.” The plasma membrane of muscle fibers is called the <term>sarcolemma</term>, the cytoplasm is referred to as <term>sarcoplasm</term>. The sarcoplasm stores glycogen and myoglobin and contains many mitochondria. The specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which stores, releases, and retrieves calcium ions (Ca<sup>++</sup>) is called the <term>sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)</term> (<link target-id="fig-ch10_02_02" document=""/>). As will soon be described, the functional unit of a skeletal muscle fiber is the sarcomere, a highly organized arrangement of the contractile myofilaments <term>actin</term> (thin filament) and <term>myosin</term> (thick filament), along with other support proteins.</para><figure id="fig-ch10_02_02"><title>Muscle Fiber </title><media id="fs-id1639162" alt="This figure shows the structure of the muscle fibers.

<para id="fs-id2044502">The sarcomere is the functional unit of the muscle fiber. The sarcomere itself is bundled within the myofibril that runs the entire length of the muscle fiber and attaches to the sarcolemma at its end. As myofibrils contract, the entire muscle cell contracts. Because myofibrils are only approximately 1.2 <emphasis effect="italics">μ</emphasis>m in diameter, hundreds to thousands (each with thousands of sarcomeres) can be found inside one muscle fiber. Each sarcomere is approximately 2 <emphasis effect="italics">μ</emphasis>m in length with a three-dimensional cylinder-like arrangement and is bordered by structures called Z-discs (also called Z-lines, because pictures are two-dimensional), to which the actin myofilaments are anchored (<link target-id="fig-ch10_02_03" document=""/>). Because the actin and its troponin-tropomyosin complex (projecting from the Z-discs toward the center of the sarcomere) form strands that are thinner than the myosin, it is called the <term>thin filament</term> of the sarcomere. Likewise, because the myosin strands and their multiple heads (projecting from the center of the sarcomere, toward but not all to way to, the Z-discs) have more mass and are thicker, they are called the <term>thick filament</term> of the sarcomere.</para><para id="eip-229">The sarcomere is also divided into several "zones," "bands," and "lines" (see <link target-id="fig-ch10_02_02" document=""/>) The A band contains both thick and thin myofilaments.

<title>Excitation-Contraction Coupling</title>
<para id="fs-id2252260">All living cells have membrane potentials, or electrical gradients across their membranes. The inside of the membrane is usually around -60 to -90 mV, relative to the outside.  This is referred to as a cell’s membrane potential. Neurons and muscle cells can use their membrane potentials to generate electrical signals. They do this by controlling the movement of charged particles, called ions, across their membranes to create electrical currents. This is achieved by opening and closing specialized proteins in the membrane called ion channels. Although the currents generated by ions moving through these channel proteins are very small, they form the basis of both neural signaling and muscle contraction.</para><para id="fs-id1421868">Both neurons and skeletal muscle cells are electrically excitable, meaning that they are able to generate action potentials. An action potential is a special type of electrical signal that can travel along a cell membrane as a wave. This allows a signal to be transmitted quickly and faithfully over long distances.</para><para id="eip-362">Although the term <term>excitation-contraction coupling</term> confuses or scares some students, it comes down to this: for a skeletal muscle fiber to contract, its membrane must first be “excited”—in other words, it must be stimulated to fire an action potential. The muscle fiber action potential, which sweeps along the sarcolemma as a wave, is “coupled” to the actual contraction through the release of calcium ions (Ca<sup>++</sup>) from the SR. Once released, the Ca<sup>++</sup> interacts with the shielding proteins, forcing them to move aside so that the actin-binding sites are available for attachment by myosin heads. The myosin then pulls the actin filaments toward the center, shortening the muscle fiber.</para><para id="eip-12">In skeletal muscle, this sequence begins with signals from the somatic motor division of the nervous system. In other words, the “excitation” step in skeletal muscles is always triggered by signaling from the nervous system (<link target-id="fig-ch10_02_04" document=""/>).</para><figure id="fig-ch10_02_04"><title>Motor End-Plate and Innervation </title><media id="fs-id1236880" alt=" Alt text to come.">

<caption>When depolarization spreads down the motor neuron (axon) and into the terminal button, this change in the membrane potential will cause voltage-gated calcium channels on the membrane of the terminal button to open. Once open, calcium influx will occur resulting in exocytosis of the synaptic vesicle containing ACh. ACh will then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to nicotinic cholinergic receptors. The nicotinic cholinergic receptors generate fast responses and as a result when ACh binds, the channel opens and sodium influx occurs and potassium efflux. There is a greater driving force for sodium than potassium efflux and influx ???????</caption></figure><para id="fs-id2019473">The motor neurons that tell the skeletal muscle fibers to contract originate in the spinal cord, with a smaller number located in the brainstem for activation of skeletal muscles of the face, head, and neck. These neurons have long processes, called axons, which are specialized to transmit action potentials long distances— in this case, all the way from the spinal cord to the muscle itself (which may be up to three feet away). The axons of multiple neurons bundle together to form nerves, like wires bundled together in a cable.</para><para id="fs-id2023666">Signaling begins when a neuronal <term>action potential</term> travels along the axon of a motor neuron, and then along the individual branches to terminate at the NMJ. At the NMJ, the axon terminal releases a chemical messenger, or <term>neurotransmitter</term>, called <term>acetylcholine (ACh)</term>. The ACh molecules diffuse across a minute space called the <term>synaptic cleft</term> and bind to nicotinic cholinergic receptors located within the <term>motor end-plate</term> of the sarcolemma on the other side of the synapse. Nicotinic cholinergic receptors area a type of ionotropic channel and therefore generate fast responses since the receptor and the channel are the same protein. Once ACh binds, the channel opens allowing sodium influx and potassium efflux. There is a greater current for sodium than potassium due to the higher driving force for sodium. As a result of the greater movement of sodium into the cell, the motor end plate depolarizes. This depolarization is called an end plate potential (a type of graded potential). </para><para id="eip-536">As the membrane depolarizes, another set of ion channels called <term>voltage-gated sodium channels</term> are triggered to open. Sodium ions enter the muscle fiber, and an action potential rapidly spreads (or “fires”) along the entire membrane to initiate excitation-contraction coupling.</para><para id="fs-id1374666">Things happen very quickly in the world of excitable membranes (just think about how quickly you can snap your fingers as soon as you decide to do it). Immediately following depolarization of the membrane, it repolarizes, re-establishing the negative membrane potential. Meanwhile, the ACh in the synaptic cleft is degraded by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) so that the ACh cannot rebind to a receptor and reopen its channel, which would cause unwanted extended muscle excitation and contraction.</para><para id="fs-id1698692">Propagation of an action potential along the sarcolemma is the excitation portion of excitation-contraction coupling. Recall that this excitation actually triggers the release of calcium ions (Ca<sup>++</sup>) from its storage in the cell’s SR. For the action potential to reach the membrane of the SR, there are periodic invaginations in the sarcolemma, called <term>T-tubules</term> (“T” stands for “transverse”). You will recall that the diameter of a muscle fiber can be up to 100 <emphasis effect="italics">μ</emphasis>m, so these T-tubules ensure that the membrane can get close to the SR in the sarcoplasm. The arrangement of a T-tubule with the membranes of SR on either side is called a <term>triad</term> (<link target-id="fig-ch10_02_05" document=""/>).

<caption>Narrow T-tubules permit the conduction of electrical impulses. The SR functions to regulate intracellular levels of calcium.
